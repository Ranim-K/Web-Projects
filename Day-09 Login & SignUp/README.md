This is the **ninth project** in a 10-website development journey using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

---

## 📌 Overview

A beautifully styled **Login and Signup Authentication Page** that demonstrates form layout, input styling, and minimal animations.

**Features:**
- Responsive login and signup form layouts
- Consistent theme with motivational quotes
- Styled buttons and inputs
- Google sign-in button with icon
- Password and email fields with placeholder behavior
- Minimalistic, modern UI with branding

---

## 💡 Purpose

This project focuses on mastering **form handling UI**, **basic component structuring**, and **visual layout** for authentication pages.

- Using consistent design across login and signup forms
- Structuring forms semantically using HTML
- Styling layout using Flexbox and custom CSS
- Creating a motivational split-screen design
- Using branding (like a logo and theme text)

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **HTML5** – for structuring the page  
- **CSS3** – for layout, colors, and responsive styling  
- **JavaScript** – basic interaction (can be expanded)  
- **Google Icon** – for social login button

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User lands on the login page with a welcoming message and quote.
2. Enters their email and password and clicks **Sign in**.
3. Alternatively, signs in using the Google button (non-functional placeholder).
4. Link available to go to the signup page.
5. On the **signup page**, users input their full name, email, password, and confirm password.
6. UI layout is mobile-responsive and consistent in both pages.

> ⚠️ *Note: Authentication is static – no backend is connected.*
