This is the third project in a 10-website development journey using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## 📌 Overview

A minimalist, responsive portfolio website that introduces a **Digital Designer**.  
It features:
- Clean typography and structured layout  
- A navigation bar with links: About, Work, Process, Contact  
- A large, bold intro title ("Digital Designer")  
- A subtle description of services on the bottom right  
- Light and dark mode toggle (☀️ / 🌙)

It gave me practical experience with:
- Typography and whitespace balance  
- Responsive layout using Flexbox  
- Implementing light/dark theme toggles with JavaScript  
- Semantic HTML structure for accessibility
