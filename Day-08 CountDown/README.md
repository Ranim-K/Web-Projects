This is the **eighth project** in a 10-website development journey using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

---

## 📌 Overview

A stylish and animated **Countdown Launch Page** built to announce upcoming products or events. The layout is responsive, minimal, and ideal for "Coming Soon" campaigns.

**Features:**
- Real-time countdown timer (days, hours, minutes, seconds)
- Sleek and modern landing page layout
- Branded header with logo/name
- Call-to-action message and email subscription field
- Social media icons in the footer

---

## 💡 Purpose

This project focuses on mastering **real-time DOM updates**, **date manipulation**, and creating an appealing **launch page UI** using JavaScript and CSS.

- Using JavaScript `Date` objects for calculating time differences
- Updating DOM every second with `setInterval`
- Designing responsive layout and visual hierarchy
- Styling and animating countdown blocks
- Basic email input interaction

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **HTML5** – page structure and semantics  
- **CSS3** – for layout, colors, icons, and animations  
- **JavaScript** – for real-time countdown logic and DOM manipulation  
- **SVG Icons** – for crisp, scalable social media buttons

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The current date is compared to a fixed launch date.
2. JavaScript calculates the difference and displays:
   - Days
   - Hours
   - Minutes
   - Seconds
3. These values are updated every second dynamically.
4. Once the countdown ends, it can be extended to trigger a message or redirect (optional).
5. Users can input an email to be notified (static, can be extended with backend later).
